This is a work-in-progress mod that adds creatures based on ones found in http://store.steampowered.com/app/322330/]Don't Starve by Klei Entertainment.

# **Features**

  - At this moment, 4 different animals (Beefalos, Rabbits, Hounds and Volt Goats)
  - High resolution graphics, additionally modified to better fit the Rimworld's graphical style
  - Separate contextual sprite sets, e.g. for sheared beefalos and sleeping animals
  - Customized rabbit AI
  - Lots of detail and small additions

# **Creatures**

**Beefalo**: A useful pack animal, similar to the Muffalo.
**Hound**: This dangerous dog-like creature behaves similarly to Wargs. Its large fangs are a valuable trade good.
**Volt Goat**: A relative of the domesticated goat that seems to exhibit an ability to collect and store ambient static electricity.
**Rabbit**: Fluffy, friendly, and utterly harmless.

# **In the future**

  - Koalefants
  - Clockwork monsters
  - And all kinds of other creatures
  - Spider hives?
  - Pig faction?!
  - Put your suggestions in the comments!

# **Compatibility**

This mod doesn't override any classes or defs and *should* be compatible with most other mods. Your mileage may vary. All feedback is much appreciated.
