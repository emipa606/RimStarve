--- Original Description ---
This is a work-in-progress mod that adds creatures based on ones found in Don't Starve by Klei Entertainment.

Features
- At this moment, 4 different animals (Beefalos, Rabbits, Hounds and Volt Goats)
- High resolution graphics, additionally modified to better fit the Rimworld's graphical style
- Separate contextual sprite sets, e.g. for sheared beefalos and sleeping animals
- Customized rabbit AI
- Lots of detail and small additions

Creatures
Beefalo: A useful pack animal, similar to the Muffalo.
Hound: This dangerous dog-like creature behaves similarly to Wargs. Its large fangs are a valuable trade good.
Volt Goat: A relative of the domesticated goat that seems to exhibit an ability to collect and store ambient static electricity.
Rabbit: Fluffy, friendly, and utterly harmless.

In the future
- Koalefants
- Clockwork monsters
- And all kinds of other creatures
- Spider hives?
- Pig faction?!
- Put your suggestions in the comments!

Compatibility
This mod doesn't override any classes or defs and should be compatible with most other mods. Your mileage may vary. All feedback is much appreciated.
